# Week 2 Lab: System Verilog

### Question Responses:

- 1. Each method has its own purpose. Exhasutive testing is better suited towards scenarios where a smaller component is being tested because then all of the cases can be written down, and the user will know 100% that the code is correct and verfiable. Sampling is effective in a scenario where you need to be testing often, since it randomly picks test, and will likely hit every test over time. However, it would likely be hard to reproduce an error if one was thrown. Random testing is the last option, which is likely the 2nd most effective technique, since it would be more likely to cover all of the cases.

### Questions to be answered:

- How are SV files actually tested, and is the printing similar to that of regular programming languages?
- I still don't 100% understand how C++, Cmake, Ninja, and SV are all related, but I guess that is something I will find out as I continue on this project.
